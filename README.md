# Intel-FPO-Decoder
A tool for decoding Intel CPU FPO/batch codes

- The script will first ask for the socket (you don't need to add "LGA" or "BGA" to the start).
- Type that in and press enter.
- You will then be asked for the FPO string - This is the 8 character long string on Intel CPU heatspreaders or present on the green/blue PCB for those without a heatspreader.
- Type the full FPO in and press enter.
- The chip information has been decoded! A log is also created in the directory you run the script in, so you can keep track of CPUs you've done before.
